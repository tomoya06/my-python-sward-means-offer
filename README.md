# web-developer-guidance

Actually it's just a notebook for keeping down some engineer experience.

> Preview: This project is origally for front-end developer, which is also my first job title after graduation. Luckily in the first year of work, I got some oppotunities to handle more than JavaScript coding, including backend(based on Springboot/MySQL/Message Queue), big data(Elasticsearch/Hive/Impala/etc.), and some Machine Learning staff(image similarity/face detect/etc.)
> 
> And this precious experience has changed me a lot. So I think it's time to jump out the border of front-end development, and make this notebook covering more fields of computer science. 

> Update: 20201026 got a new job offer in ByteDance Inc, Shanghai, working as web engineer. The new journey will start in Dec.
